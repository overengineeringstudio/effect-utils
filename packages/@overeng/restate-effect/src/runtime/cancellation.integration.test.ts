/**
 * Cancellation ↔ interruption integration test against a real native
 * `restate-server` (R31, decision 0003, docs/vrs/04-error-boundary/spec.md §2).
 *
 * Proves the cancel→interrupt boundary end-to-end: a keyed Object handler that
 * suspends on a long durable `Restate.sleep`, guarded by an `acquireRelease`
 * finalizer. The test `send`s the handler (getting its invocation id), waits for
 * the handler to acquire its resource, cancels the invocation via the admin API
 * (`PATCH /invocations/{id}/cancel`), and asserts:
 *
 * - the `acquireRelease` RELEASE finalizer ran (the Restate cancellation surfaced
 *   as an Effect interruption at the suspend point — `onInterrupt`/`acquireRelease`
 *   fire, R31), and
 * - the handler did NOT silently retry (the bridge interrupts the fiber and
 *   `toTerminal` maps the interruption to a `CancelledError`, not a retry).
 *
 * The endpoint runs in-process, so the finalizer's observable side effect is a
 * module-level shared map keyed by the Object key.
